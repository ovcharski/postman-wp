# postman-wp

A Postman collection for API testing a demo website based on Wordpress and WooCommerce. This collection is addition to the Playwright E2E Testing Framework in this [repo](https://github.com/ovcharski/playwright-e2e)

This repo for the moment is low priority. It is just an example of idea to use a combination of Playwright UI and Postman API testing in a one whole package. For the moment the collectios is just with public APIs.
