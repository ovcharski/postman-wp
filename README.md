# newman

A good way to run Postman collections is via [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman).

Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to effortlessly run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems.
